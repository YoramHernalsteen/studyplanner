StudyPlanner is a web application made with PHP, Laravel, JS and PostgreSQL. It is hosted on Heroku. 

It's main function is to help students plan their workload and tell them how they are doing. 

Functions include:

* Calendar function: plan your own week, with both classes and homework

StudyPlanner was made with mobile use in mind, so usability on mobile devices should be great.
